# Pawsome Classifier

## 
Summary My idea in a nutshell: Pawsome Classifier is a project that uses AI and machine learning to classify images of dogs and cats.

## Background
The problem my project aims to solve is the ability to accurately classify images of dogs and cats. This problem is common and frequent, especially with the rise of social media platforms where pet owners share pictures of their furry friends.

**Data and AI Techniques:**
Pawsome Classifier relies on a dataset of labeled images of dogs and cats. The dataset will be sourced from various online platforms, such as Kaggle and Google Drive. The AI techniques used will include convolutional neural networks (CNNs), specifically the VGG16 architecture, which has been shown to be effective in image classification tasks.

**How is it Used:**
Pawsome Classifier will be used in a variety of contexts, including:

* Pet owners can use the classifier to organize their pet photos and identify breeds
* Veterinarians can use the classifier to aid in diagnosing and treating pets
* Animal shelters can use the classifier to identify and categorize pets in their care

The people affected by Pawsome Classifier will be pet owners, veterinarians, and animal shelter workers.

**Challenges:**
Pawsome Classifier does not solve the issue of bias in the dataset, which can affect the accuracy of the model. Additionally, the classifier may not be able to identify specific breeds or recognize pets with unusual appearances.

**What Next:**
To further develop Pawsome Classifier, I plan to:

* Collect a larger and more diverse dataset
* Experiment with different architectures and hyperparameters
* Integrate the classifier with other AI technologies, such as natural language processing (NLP) to create a comprehensive pet management system
